Understanding your Bill
-----------------------

With effect from 5 November 2021, there will be a change in bill format. This new bill format is consistent with all other public healthcare institutions.

The new bill format will:

1. Standardise information presented in healthcare bills across healthcare institutions and care settings.
2. Clearly indicate the pre-and-post subsidy costs, and how various financing schemes will help you to pay for the remaining amount.
3. Provide options on bill payment methods, including an SGQR code for online payment for added convenience. Patients can also access their bills and make payments on HealthHub.

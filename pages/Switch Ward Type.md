#### **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

**What is Means Testing?**<br>
Means testing is a way of determining if a person or household is eligible to receive some sort of benefit or payment. Means testing lets patients share limited class B2 and C wards in a fair manner, by targeting subsidies at lower-income group.

**When is means testing required?**<br>
Means testing is required when there is a request to switch from a private ward type (A or B1 ward) to a lower subsidised ward type (B2 or C ward).

**Why is means testing required when switching from private ward to a subsidised ward?** <br>
This is a standard practice at all public hospitals. Means testing will allow us to determine the eligibility for subsidies at B2 ward or C ward.

**When will the pricing for the lower ward type take effect?**<br>
Pricing for the lower ward type will take effect once the patient has been successfully transferred to the lower ward type.

**How do I know the status of my outpatient appointments after discharge?**<br>
The status of your outpatient appointments is related to the ward type of your inpatient admission upon discharge. B2 ward and C ward will fall under subsidised rates for outpatient treatment while A ward and B1 ward will fall under private rates.

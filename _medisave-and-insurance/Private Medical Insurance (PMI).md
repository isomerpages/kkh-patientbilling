[Private Medical Insurance (PMI)](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/healthcare-financing/supplements/what-is-a-private-integrated-shield-plan-ip)Â is a scheme which allows CPF members to use their MediSave savings to buy MediSave-approved Integrated Shield Plans for themselves and their dependents. Dependents refer to a member's parents, spouse, children, grandparents, and siblings.

Each insured person can only have one MediSave-approved Integrated Shield Plan paid with MediSave.

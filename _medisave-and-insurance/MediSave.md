MediSave is a national medical savings scheme that helps individuals set aside part of their income to pay for their personal or approved dependents' hospitalisations, day surgeries and selected outpatient treatments. There are withdrawal limits which have been carefully set to ensure that Singaporeans have sufficient savings in their MediSave Account to pay for their basic healthcare needs.

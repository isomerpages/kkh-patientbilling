MediSave is a national medical savings scheme that helps individuals set aside part of their income to pay for their personal or approved dependents' hospitalisations, day surgeries and selected outpatient treatments. There are withdrawal limits which have been carefully set to ensure that Singaporeans have sufficient savings in their MediSave Account to pay for their basic healthcare needs.

**[Find out more about the MediSave withdrawal limits here](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/healthcare-financing/using-your-medisave-savings)**.

#####  **Using MediSave to pay for family member's medical bills:**
You can use your MediSave account to pay for hospital bills incurred by yourself, your spouse, children, parents, grandparents or siblings.<br>
To use MediSave for your grandparents or siblings however, they must be Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents.
